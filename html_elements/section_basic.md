# Basic

Basic elements are the backbone of any HTML document. You'll see these elements in the source code for all web pages after the doctype declaration on the first line of the page. The doctype specifies which version of (X)HTML that page is using. Elements comprising the contents of a Web page are placed between the opening `<html>` tag and the closing `</html>` tag. The `<html>` element is also known as the root element.
